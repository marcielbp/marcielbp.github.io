## [Optical Mark Recognition](https://www.github.com/marcielbp/omr-opencv-python/)

I intent to use this software to mark recognition on sheet templates to encourage students to learn binary numbers. My goal is using a pen-marked paper to execute an [assembly code](https://marcielbp.github.io/assembler-simulator/). I've been developing this application in python language using opencv libray.

Contributing with [André Meireles](https://github.com/andremeirelesa)

USAGE: [Lattes website](http://lattes.cnpq.br/)
This software is designed to verify conflits of interest between two people based on Lattes platform. Our intention was indicate which autors have work with one another by looking in `.xml` files available in Lattes. Our software returns a score for each found author in order to make possible a non automated verify of similarities.
